# Langtons-Ant-Basic-Model
This is the final project of my intro to computer science class taken in 2016

This program models Langton's Ant in a very basic visual model using C++

When running the executable, command line arguments should be given: 
  -f FILENAME -d direction -x starting_row -y starting_column -n num_of_steps
  
  The input file must contain two integers, one for the number of rows of the model and one for the number of columns.
  
  The direction the ant starts must be "up", "down", "left" or "right"
  
  The starting row and starting column are integer numbers where the ant starts
  
  The number of steps are how many iterations the model goes through.
